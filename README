Quick Project Info:
===================

PyDev + ECF + ECF4PyDev = [From Python Editor] Share Editor With...

Quick Start
===========
You're an Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) user. Maybe you're on 3.6, maybe your on 3.8. Either way, you also use PyDev. You think to yourself, I wish there was a SIMPLE baked in way to show someone a few lines of code I'm working on.

Install PyDev:
  http://pydev.org/updates
Install ECF 3.5.3 from:
  http://download.eclipse.org/rt/ecf/3.5.3/site.p2
Then this simple plugin I made from here:
  http://gilberterik.github.com/ECF4PyDev

You should be able to use ECF alone to log in to an XMPP provider, like Google Talk, and share your Java and Plaintext editor.  Installing my plugin simply bolts on the 10 lines of XML to enable the same feature in PyDev's Python Editor
